What you need to make:

alnfof.txt: a file that contains the names of all genes to test with the .phy extension






Script files:

Round #1 with foreground species (test for species-specific positive selection):
codeml_templateBS1
codeml_templateBS2
codeml_templateM1

Round #2 with no foreground species (test for treewide positive selection):
codeml_templateM1
codeml_templateM2
codeml_templateM8
codeml_templateM8A

At the top of all template files are the following lines to edit for specific genes:

seqfile: alignment file with species of interest
treefile: phylogenetic tree.  Branch lengths are irrelevant, species set should match the species of interest in seqfile.  Foreground species are indicated as #1 after species name
outfile: chosen name of the output file







--------------------------------------Instructions--------------------------------------

Step 1:
	Select genes of interest
	make alnfof.txt with filenames of genes of interest
	
Step 2:
	Trim aligns and trees to desired species set using TrimAlnsofinterest.R
	In script, specify desired species set, foreground, and file locations

Step 3:
	Similarly, run MakeNumberedTrees.R to make trees with specified foreground
	
Step 4:
	Run MakeTemplatesAndBash.R to fill in templates and write the bash file to run them all
	
Step 5 (optional):
	If you are running the models somewhere other than where you generated the above files (i.e. moving everything to a cluster or server),
	maintain the file organizational structure and move numberedtrees, trimmedalns, bashfile, and writtentemplates and run the bashfile

Step 6:
	Run ExtractOutput to make csv files with lnl and statistics
	
Step 7:
	Run MakeTreesAndFiles to remove foreground species from alns and trees to test for tree-wide positive selection
	
Step 8:
	Run MakeRound2Bash to make bash file
	
Step 9 (optional):
	If you are running the models somewhere other than where you generated the above files (i.e. moving everything to a cluster or server),
	maintain the file organizational structure and move trimmedtrees, trimmedalns, bashfile, and writtentemplates and run the bashfile
